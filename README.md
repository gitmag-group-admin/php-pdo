# PHP PDO

PHP PDO is a database access layer that provides a uniform interface for working with multiple databases.

PDO simplifies the common database operations including:

-   Creating database connections
-   Executing queries using prepared statements
-   Calling stored procedures
-   Performing transactions
-   And handling errors

PDO allows you to work with any database that has a PDO driver available. PDO relies on database-specific drivers, e.g., PDO_MYSQL for MySQL, PDO_PGSQL for PostgreSQL, PDO_OCI for Oracle database, etc., to function properly.

Therefore, to use PDO for a specific database, you need to have a corresponding database driver available.

The following diagram illustrates how PDO works:
